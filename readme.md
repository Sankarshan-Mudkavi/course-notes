## TC Fraser's Course Notes

This is the repository that contains all of the `.tex` source files and figures used for my course notes. They *do not contain the latex templates* used. Those can be found in [another repo](https://github.com/tcfraser/latex-packages).

If you are just interested in the `.pdf` files, I suggest you visit my website [here](http://tcfraser.com/coursenotes/).

If you notice any mistakes, feel free to make a pull request or just email me at tcfraser@tcfraser.com.
