\section{Introduction}

\subsection{What is Statistical Mechanics}

Statistical Mechanics is thearea of Physics interested in systems with a large number of degress of freedon $n$. Note that these variables can be interacting or not. \\

There are two distinct class of Statistical Mechanics: equilibrium and non-equilibrium. \\

The Statistical part of Statistical Mechanics implies that it is inherently a study of probabilities and probability distributions. These laws must still remain fully consistent with physical laws. \\

Typically, systems are analyzed on a microscopic level. For a system of particles $\bc{q_i}$ and their positions.
